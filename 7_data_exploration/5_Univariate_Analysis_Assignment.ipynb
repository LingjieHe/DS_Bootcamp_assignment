    "In this assignment, you'll continue working with the U.S. Education Dataset from Kaggle. The data gives detailed, state-level information on the several facets of the state of education on an annual basis. To learn more about the data and the column descriptions, you can view the Kaggle link above.  \n",

    "1, Derive the descriptive statistics of the data and discuss the points you find remarkable.  \n",
    "2, Choose a state (such as California) and draw a line graph of its total revenues and total expenditures over the years. How do these two variables evolve during these years? Try to explain the peaks and troughs with some state-wise news and information around those dates.  \n",
    "3, In your chosen state, in which of the lessons are the students more successfulâ€”math or reading?  \n",
    "4, What are the distributions of the math and reading scores in the sample?  \n",
    "5, Now, look again at the original dataset (before you filled in the missing values). Notice there are too many missing values for math and reading scores. Fill out the missing values using mean, median, and linear interpolation. Then, compare the effects of these techniques on the distributions of the score variables.  "
